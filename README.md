# Interview Tests

This is a series of software engineering tests designed to evaluate candidates' skills in various areas. They're mainly focused on problem solving, debugging process, and undertanding of app structure.

## Tests

### 1. Mid Level React Developer

To download the test, run the following command:

```bash
npx degit KeeghanM/interview-tests/mid-level-react mid-level-react
cd mid-level-react
npm install
```

This will clone the `mid-level-react` test into a new directory called `mid-level-react`. You can then open the README.md file in that directory for instructions.

You can use any tools you like to complete the test, so that it reflects your true day-to-day work.
